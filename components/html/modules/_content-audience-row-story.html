					<p>Taylor Zike has taken brotherly love to a whole new level &#8212; one that has changed the course of his life.</p>
					<p>Growing up, Taylor and his older brother, Derek, were the biggest rivals. But that all changed in 2009, when Derek suffered an injury during a game of hockey.</p>
					<p>Seeing the doctors work on Derek inspired Taylor to change his career goals. He's now a  Movement and Sports Sciences major with an eye toward becoming a doctor.</p>
					<p>"He is my hero and he's the reason I want to go to medical school," Taylor says.</p>
					<p>Taylor also shared his story through a promotion with Dr Pepper and received a scholarship and his picture on cans and bottles of the drink.</p>
